## Simple Summary 

Make the proposal's block-reward probability fair.

## Abstract 

In the consensus algorithm, the selection of the proposer needs to be random and fair. We need to design a reasonable solution to meet these two requirements.

## Motivation 

In the Chiron consensus algorithm,  we adapt VRF algorithm to make the selection of proposer random and secret. But for POS chain,  the common understanding of defending against sybil attacks is to proportional the proposal's block-reward probability to his stake. If it is not designed in this way, the malicious user can gain excess profits in mining through multiple IDs.

## Specification 

Currently， the formula to compare tow blocks' weight includes the following logic:

```
// BlockWeight denotes the weight of one block
type BlockWeight struct {
	Hash    common.Hash
	TotalQN uint64   // Same as TotalQN field of BlockHeader
	PV      *big.Int // Converted from ProveValue field of BlockHeader
}

// Cmp compares the weight between current block and the given one.
// 1 returns if current block is more weight
// 0 returns if equal
// otherwise -1 is returned
func (bw *BlockWeight) Cmp(bw2 *BlockWeight) int {	
	if bw.TotalQN > bw2.TotalQN {
		return 1			
 	} else if bw.TotalQN < bw2.TotalQN {
 		return -1
 	}
 	return bw.PV.Cmp(bw2.PV)
}
```

If block `height >= 931588`, we change the compare method to the following:

```
// BlockWeight denotes the weight of one block
type BlockWeight struct {
	Proposer common.Address
	PreHash  common.Hash
	Height   uint64
	Hash     common.Hash
	TotalQN  uint64   // Same as TotalQN field of BlockHeader
	PV       *big.Int // Converted from ProveValue field of BlockHeader
}

// normalizePV returns the pv value after normalization by the stake
func (bw *BlockWeight) normalizePV() *big.Rat {
	stake := DefaultStakeGetter(bw.Proposer, bw.PreHash)
	if stake == 0 {
		return new(big.Rat).SetInt64(0)
	}
	return new(big.Rat).Quo(new(big.Rat).SetInt(bw.PV), new(big.Rat).SetFloat64(float64(stake)))
}


// Cmp compares the weight between current block and the given one.
// 1 returns if current block is more weight
// 0 returns if equal
// otherwise -1 is returned
func (bw *BlockWeight) Cmp(bw2 *BlockWeight) int {
	if bw.TotalQN > bw2.TotalQN {
		return 1
	} else if bw.TotalQN < bw2.TotalQN {
		return -1
	}
	if params.GetChainConfig().IsZIP001(bw.Height) && params.GetChainConfig().IsZIP001(bw2.Height) && DefaultStakeGetter != nil {
		np1 := bw.normalizePV()
		np2 := bw2.normalizePV()
		cmp := np1.Cmp(np2)
		// If normalization pv is equal, then the absolute pv is compared
		if cmp != 0 {
			return cmp
		}
	}
	return bw.PV.Cmp(bw2.PV)
}
```

## Rationale 
In old method, the proposer with high stake can gain more rewards，compared to the proposer with low stake. 
This new formula uses the normalization of pv versus stake， and ensures that the selection of proposer more fair than the previous method.
